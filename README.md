## Setup Instructions and Demo
**We are only requesting view permissions. This does not give us access to your private keys nor the ability move your funds.**

This is just a one-time, 2 min setup procedure ü§ì

To allow us to send you alerts on your CoinbasePro trades, you will need to generate and provide us with API key:
1. Start API input process using /coinbase_pro_api or the Add API button on the [@FillsAlertBot telegram bot](tg://resolve?domain=FillsAlertBot). The bot will wait for you to enter the passphrase
2. Open the Coinbase Pro [API Settings](https://pro.coinbase.com/profile/api) page
3. Click the + New API Key button
4. Copy the passphrase and pass it to the bot. It will wait for you to enter the API Secret
4. Under Permissions only select View
5. If applicable, enter your two-factor authentication code
6. Click Create API Key
7. Copy the API Secret shown on the dialog box and pass it to the bot. It will wait for API Key now
8. Copy the API Key after closing the dialog box and pass it to the bot. If everything works, you are done!
